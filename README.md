# Image Steganography and Steganalysis

## üìö Introduction

My name is **Stefano Caramagno**, and I'm pleased to present this repository containing a project on creation of an **image steganography and steganalysis** tool. <br>
This project was completed as part of the **Digital Forensics** course during my **Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering** at the **University of Catania**.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Web Application**: Provides a user-friendly interface for encoding and decoding hidden messages in images.
- **Image Steganography**: Embeds secret messages into images using Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique.
- **Image Steganalysis**: Detects potential hidden messages within an image to analyze its integrity.
- **Encoding Module**: Allows users to insert and retrieve hidden text in images via a simple web interface.
- **Decoding Module**: Extracts embedded messages from steganographic images using an automated detection process.
- **Flask Server Integration**: Hosts the application locally, making it accessible through a web browser.
- **Python-Based Processing**: Executes steganographic algorithms efficiently using Python libraries.
- **HTML Templates for UI**: Uses pre-built HTML files to render encoding, decoding, and homepage views dynamically.
- **Custom CSS Styling**: Enhances the UI design with a modern and responsive layout.
 
## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Frontend Development**:  
  - **HTML** for structuring and organizing web content.  
  - **CSS** for styling, layout, and responsive design.  
- **Backend Development**:  
  - **Python** for implementing server-side logic and processing data.  
  - **Flask** for creating and managing API endpoints to handle client requests.  
- **Relevant Libraries**:  
  - **NumPy** for efficient numerical operations and data manipulation.  
  - **OpenCV** for advanced image processing and computer vision tasks.   
- **Dependency Management**: Pip for installing and managing project dependencies.  
- **IDE**: Visual Studio Code for development and debugging.  
- **Version Control**: Git for tracking changes and managing project versions.  
- **Repository Hosting**: GitHub for storing, sharing, and maintaining the project repository.  

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed on your system before proceeding:

- **Python**: Version 3.9 or later, required to run the application.  
- **Required Libraries**: Install the following libraries using `pip` from the terminal:
