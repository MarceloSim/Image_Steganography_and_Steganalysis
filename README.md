Welcome to the **Image Steganography and Steganalysis** repository! This project was completed as part of the Digital Forensics course during my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Catania. Here, we explore the fascinating world of hiding information within images and the techniques to detect such hidden data.

## Introduction

Steganography is the practice of concealing messages within other non-secret text or data. In our project, we focus on image steganography, which involves hiding data within images. This method can be useful for secure communication, data protection, and more. Conversely, steganalysis refers to the techniques used to detect the presence of hidden information. This project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of both concepts.

## Project Overview

The **Image Steganography and Steganalysis** project implements various algorithms for hiding and extracting information from images. The project also includes tools for analyzing images to detect any hidden data. The main components of the project include:

- **Encoding**: Algorithms to embed data into images.
- **Decoding**: Methods to extract hidden data from images.
- **Analysis**: Techniques to identify whether an image contains hidden information.

The project structure is designed to facilitate easy navigation and understanding of the algorithms and methods used.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a variety of technologies and programming languages:

- **Python**: The main programming language for implementing algorithms.
- **Flask**: A web framework for building the web interface.
- **OpenCV**: A library for image processing.
- **NumPy**: A library for numerical operations.
- **HTML/CSS**: For front-end development.
- **Markdown**: For documentation.
- **Git/GitHub**: For version control and collaboration.
- **Data Structures**: To efficiently manage and process data.

## Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MarceloSim/Image_Steganography_and_Steganalysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd Image_Steganography_and_Steganalysis
   ```

3. Install the required packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Flask application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

You can now access the web application in your browser at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can use the following features:

- **Encode Data**: Upload an image and enter the message you want to hide. The application will process the image and embed the message.
- **Decode Data**: Upload an image that may contain hidden data. The application will extract any hidden messages.
- **Analyze Image**: Use the analysis tools to check if an image has hidden information.

For detailed instructions, please refer to the user guide available in the documentation folder.
